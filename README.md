1. Initializing a Git Repository:
•	Open your project folder in VS Code.
•	Go to the Source Control view (usually on the left side bar).
•	Click the "+" button and select "Initialize Repository". This creates a new Git repository 
within your project folder.

2. Making Commits:
•	After making changes to your code, stage them for the next commit. Staged changes are included in the next commit snapshot. You can stage specific lines, files, or all changes.
o	Use the Source Control view: Click the checkbox next to the desired file/line or right-click and select "Stage Changes".
o	Use the keyboard shortcut: Stage all changes with Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) and search for "Stage All Changes".
•	Once you have staged your changes, provide a descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes made.
o	In the Source Control view, type your commit message in the text box below the staged changes.
•	Commit your staged changes:
o	Click the blue checkmark button in the Source Control view.
o	Alternatively, use Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Enter (macOS).

3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:
•	You'll need a GitHub account and a remote repository set up for your project on GitHub.
•	In VS Code, make sure you have configured your Git with your GitHub account credentials. You can usually do this through the integrated terminal commands. Refer to GitHub's documentation for specific instructions.
•	With your remote repository linked, use the Source Control view to push your commits to GitHub.
o	Click the "..." button next to the branch name (usually "main").
o	Select "Publish Branch". This will initiate the push process, sending your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
                  
            Using VS Code with GitHub:
•	Install the GitHub extension for seamless integration.
•	Use the Source Control view to manage branches, pull requests, and more.

                  Additional Tips:
•	Use the "Git: View Changes" command (Ctrl+Shift+G) to see a detailed view of all changes made before committing.
•	Utilize the "Git: Undo Last Local Commit" command (Ctrl+Shift+P) to revert the most recent commit if needed.
•	VS Code offers features like code history and branching for more advanced version control workflows. Explore the documentation for a deeper understanding.
By integrating Git with VS Code, you can effectively track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of your code if necessary.
